# gMap for V3 Google Maps API

[gMap](http://www.smashinglabs.pl/gmap) is a jQuery plugin embedding Google Maps into your website.
  
## Documentation

Check out gMap's documentation [here](http://www.smashinglabs.pl/gmap-documentation)

## Features

gMap allows you to:

* Set initial position and type of map
* Set minimum, maximum and initial zoom level
* Add multiple markers with custom icons, popups and titles
* Position marker by latitude/longitude as well as by its address (Using Google Geocoding API)
* Set your customized map controls
* Retrieve map object and use it for [even most complex tasks](http://www.smashinglabs.pl/gmap-alpha-examples)

Purpose of gMap is to help you keep your code clean and to create Google Map in very easy way, without learning its API. In future versions gMap will be improved with functions that are hard to achieve with Google Maps. Hopefully it will turn into great data visualisation tool, while still maintaining its simplicity.
